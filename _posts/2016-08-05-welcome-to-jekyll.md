As short as my interaction with the whole programming world might yet be (1 year and few months) I have already grown an enormous interest for all of it. The thinking method, the amount of things we can do with programming, all of it amazes me.
I am currently on my second year out of five of my integrated master's degree on software engineering @ University of Minho.
I aim now to learn the most of it, so I can be in the future, hopefully, a successful software developer.
