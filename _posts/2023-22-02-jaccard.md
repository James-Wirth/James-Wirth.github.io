# The Jaccard similarity coefficient

Hi, i pretend make a very simple explication about the jaccard index: is a measure of simmilarity, basically measure the similitude between 2 sets of information. The Jaccard similarity coefficient, it was created by Grove Karl Gilbert in 1884 and have the most diverse applications from [conductual research](https://basurafernando.github.io/papers/AnticipationCVPR21.pdf) to [single-cell cluster stability](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33165513/), passing evidently by the NPL. To understand clearly is necesary study a little bit of set theory, or if you are a SQL coder can be interpretated as the measure of a inner join.

To start in python we need to define two sets, evidently over load the libraries.

```python
# libraries
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib_venn as venn
```

```python
S = {1, 2, 3}
T = {3, 4, 5}
```

To see the ven diagrams we use the matplotlib_venn library

```python
venn.venn2([S, T], set_labels=('S','T'))
plt.show()
```

![Venn Intersection]()

```python
# Both intersection method or & can be used
Intersection = S.intersection(T)
print("Intersection of S and T:", S_intersection)
```

Now we can see how the intersection of the two datasets are in "3", then to calculate the jaccard we need follow the formula:

![JaccardFormula](https://github.com/devicemxl/devicemxl.github.io/blob/master/_posts/imgs/20232202jaccard.001.svg?raw=true)

```math
\ J = TP / ( TP + FP + FN )
```

The significate of this is that the values of 
```html
<div class="mb1">
  test
</div>
```
