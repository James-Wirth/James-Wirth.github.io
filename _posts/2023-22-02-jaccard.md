# The Jaccard similarity coefficient

Hello, I intend to make a very simple explanation about the jaccard index: it is a measure of similarity, basically it measures the similarity between 2 sets of information. The Jaccard similarity coefficient was created by Grove Karl Gilbert in 1884 and has the most diverse applications from [behavioral research](https://basurafernando.github.io/papers/AnticipationCVPR21.pdf) to [stability of unicellular clusters] (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33165513/), obviously going through the NPL. To understand clearly you need to study a bit of set theory, or if you're a SQL coder it can be interpreted as the measure of an inner join.

I know sometimes is very innecesary learn all that things, sure?

To get started in python we need to define two sets, obviously after loading the libraries.

```python
# libraries
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib_venn as venn
```

```python
GroupA = {1, 2, 3}
GroupB = {3, 4, 5}
```

To see the ven diagrams we use the matplotlib_venn library

```python
venn.venn2([GroupA, GroupB], set_labels=('Group A','GroupB'))
plt.show()
```

![Venn Intersection](https://github.com/devicemxl/devicemxl.github.io/blob/master/_posts/imgs/20232202jaccard.003.png?raw=true)

```python
# Intersection method
#
Intersection = GroupA.intersection(GroupB)
print("Intersection of GroupA and GroupB:", Intersection)
```

Intersection of GroupA and GroupB: {3}


Now we can see how the intersection of the two datasets are in "3", then to calculate the jaccard we need follow the formula:

![JaccardFormula](https://github.com/devicemxl/devicemxl.github.io/blob/master/_posts/imgs/20232202jaccard.001.svg?raw=true)

And the expression can be canceptually translated as:

```math

Jaccard = Intersection / ( GroupA + GroupB - Intersection )

Jaccard = 1 / ( 3 + 3 - 1)
Jaccard = 1/5
Jaccard = 0.2

```

In python a specific code can be:

```python
# specific code
#
len(Intersection) / ( len(GroupA) + len(GroupB) - len(Intersection) )
```

Of course generally you need to compare list of items, then you need make loop in the Source list to compare in each record of the comparison list. I make a little code for this. you can review, enjoy and make corrections. Always are welcome!
