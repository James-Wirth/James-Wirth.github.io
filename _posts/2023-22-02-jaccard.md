# The Jaccard similarity coefficient

Hi, i pretend make a very simple explication about the jaccard index: is a measure of simmilarity, basically measure the similitude between 2 sets of information. The Jaccard similarity coefficient, it was created by Grove Karl Gilbert in 1884 and have the most diverse applications from [conductual research](https://basurafernando.github.io/papers/AnticipationCVPR21.pdf) to [single-cell cluster stability](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33165513/), passing evidently by the NPL. To understand clearly is necesary study a little bit of set theory, or if you are a SQL coder can be interpretated as the measure of a inner join.
